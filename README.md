# Encrypt-Decrypt-A-Message
In this Python project, I created a program that enabled a user to input a message that they wished to either encrypt or decrypt to a friend. 
In order to properly encrypt or decrypt a message, the user would add a number of their choosing at the end of the message that would then dictate how many spots within the alphabet that a letter would be moved. 
Additionally, the numeric values 0-9 were included within the alphabet to allow further encryption or decryption of the user's initial message as well as enable the user to input numeric values ranging from 0-9 within their original message. 
The message format was as such: enc(dec)<>*their message*<>*a number of their choosing*. 
The project aimed at protecting private conversations amongst individuals from prying third parties.
